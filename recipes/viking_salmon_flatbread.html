    <h1>Viking Salmon with Flatbread and Skagen Sauce</h1>
    <img src="images/viking-salmon-and-flatbread.jpg">
    <h3>We tend to think of Vikings as ferocious warriors with carnivorous tastes, but the real Viking diet was surprisingly light and nutritious.</h2>
    <p>They ate berries, vegetable soups and barley risottos, and something like this simple roasted salmon with flatbreads might have been just the kind of meal a 
        terrifying Viking might have loved between raiding parties.</p>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS NEEDED</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 kg side of salmon, skin on, pin-boned
            sea salt flakes, to season
            watercress, to serve</li>
        <h3>Skagen Sauce</h3>
        <li>150 g(½ cup) mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 tbspsour cream or crème fraiche</li>
        <li>1 tspDijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 tbspfinely chopped dill</li>
        <li>½ cabbage</li>
        <li>60 ml(¼ cup) whitefish or salmon roe
            finely grated zest of 1 lemon
            juice of ½ lemon</li>
        <h3>Viking Flatbread</h3>
        <li>300 g(2 cups) plain flour</li>
        <li>75 g(½ cup) rye flour</li>
        <li>75 g(½ cup) spelt flour</li>
        <li>375 ml(1½ cups) buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 tspsalt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Nail the salmon to a plank of wood with wooden nails, flesh-side facing up. Season well with salt. Place vertically next to a fire at a distance where it 
            becomes uncomfortable to hold your hand after 10 seconds.</li>
        <li>Cook for 20-30 minutes, tail-side up, then flip vertically and continue for a further 20-30 minutes until just cooked through.</li>
        <li>To make the skagen sauce, combine all the ingredients together in a bowl and refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
        <li>To make the Viking flatbread, combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl, then make a well in the centre. 
            Gradually add the buttermilk and stir until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth. Roll the dough into 5 cm balls, 
            then using your hands, pinch and flatten the balls to about 5 mm thick.</li>
        <li>Toast the flatbreads in a dry frying pan over high heat or on a hot stone in the fire for about 1-2 minutes each side until golden in parts and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Serve the salmon with the skagen sauce, flatbread and watercress.</li>
    </ol>
