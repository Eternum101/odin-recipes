    <h1>Crockpot Medieval Viking Stew</h1>
    <img src="images/viking-stew-recipe.jpg">
    <h3>Going back a long time we use to cook these crockpot stews all the time. Vikings used whatever they had at their disposal. 
        This recipe includes many variations as well as what to serve with it.</h2>
    <h2>WHAT MAKES THIS UNIQUE</h2>
    <p>So why write just another crockpot recipe? Simple. This one is different from the rest and it tastes completely unique. We start off by embracing our heritage of cooking with fire. 
        Yes, fire.</p>
    <p>Not gas or fan assisted ovens or induction but good a good old fire. You know - those things that used to keep us warm in the cold snowy nights and 
        served as our entertainment before YouTube and Facebook came along.
    </p>
    <p>
        You do not have to use fire, but it will really make it special as the food slowly takes up a smoky flavour from the burning wood.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternatively you would use a crockpot and add a smokey element in the stew. Like GREAT QUALITY smoked sausage or smoked lamb, venison or beef rib.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you can't find any then add a touch of NATURAL smoke liquid. Natural smoke liquid is just condensed smoke. No strange flavourings or chemicals.
